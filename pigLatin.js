/**
 * Pig Latin is a way of altering English Words. The rules are as follows:
 * If a word begins with a consonant, take the first consonant or consonant cluster, move it to the end of the word, and add ay to it.
 * If a word begins with a vowel, just add way at the end.
 */

//Translate the provided string to Pig Latin. Input strings are guaranteed to be English words in all lowercase.

function translatePigLatin(str) {
    return str;
}
translatePigLatin("consonant");

/**
 * Problem Explanation
 * You need to create a program that will translate from English to Pig Latin. PigLatin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay". If a word begins with a vowel you just add "way" to the end. It might not be obvious but you need to remove all the consonants up to the first vowel in case the word does not start with a vowel.
 */

//Hint 1ï¼šYou will probably want to use regular expressions. This will allow you to convert the words easily.
//Hint 2: If the first character is a vowel, then take that whole word and add 'way' at the end. Otherwise comes the tricky part, take the consonant(s) before the first vowel and move it to the end and add 'ay'. This might be confusing but, it is not just the first consonant but all of them before the first vowel.
//Hint 3: You will need to use everything you know about string manipulation to get the last part right. However, it can be done with substr alone.

//Solution 1
function translatePigLatin(str) {
    let consonantRegex = /^[^aeiou]+/;
    let myConsonants = str.match(consonantRegex);
    return myConsonants !== null
        ? str
            .replace(consonantRegex, "")
            .concat(myConsonants)
            .concat("ay")
        : str.concat("way");
}
translatePigLatin("consonant");

/**
 * Code Explanation
 * start at beginning and get longest match of everything not a vowel (consonants)
 * if regex pattern found, it saves the match; else, it returns null
 * if regex pattern found (starts with consonants), it deletes match, adds the match to the end, and adds "ay" to the end
 * if regex pattern not found (starts with vowels), it just adds "way" to the ending
 */

//Solution 2
function translatePigLatin(str) {
    //Create variables to be used
    var pigLatin = "";
    var regex = /[aeiou]/gi;

    //Check if the first character is a vowel
    if (str[0].match(regex)) {
        pigLatin = str + "way";
    } else if (str.match(regex) === null) {
        // Check if the string contains only consonants
        pigLatin = str + "ay";
    } else {
        //Find how many consonants before the first vowel.
        var vowelIndice = str.indexOf(srt.match(regex)[0]);

        //Take the string from the first vowel to the last char
        //Then add the consonants that were previously omitted and add the ending.
        pigLatin = str.substr(vowelIndice) + str.substr(0, vowelIndice) + "ay";
    }

    return pigLatin;

translatePigLatin("consonant");

/**
 * Code Explanation
 * Make an empty string to hold your Pig Latin word.
 * Assign your appropriate regular expression to a variable.
 * If the first character is a vowel, just add way to end of string and return it.
 * If the first character is not a vowel:
 * -Find number of consonants before first cowel till the end.
 * -Start Pig Latin string with first vowel to end of string.
 * -substr() is used for string manipulation here.
 * -Add ay to end of string and return it.
 */


//Solution 3
function translatePigLatin(str) {
    if (str.match(/^[aeiou]/)) return str + "way";

    const consonantCluster = str.match(/^[^aeiou]+/)[0];
    return str.substring(consonantCluster.length) + consonantCluster + "ay";
}
translatePigLatin("consonant");

/**
 * Code Explanation
 * 
 * First, check to see if the string begins with vowel.
 * -The regex looks at the beginning of the string^ for one of the specified characters [aeiou]
 * -if it does, you only need to return the original string with "way" appended on the end.
 * 
 * If the string does not start with a vowel, we want to build a string which contains evvery consonant before the first vowel in the provided string.
 * -To do this, look at the beginning of a string^ for one or more characters + NOT specified [^aeiou].
 * -If there is a match (and in this case, there always will be), match() returns an Array with the matched string as the first element, which is all we want. Grab it with[0].
 * 
 * Now, we can start building our Pig Latin string to return. This can be built in three parts:
 * -The first part contains all of the characters in the original string, starting from the first vowel. We can easily get these characters by creating a substring of the original string, with its starting index being the first vowel.
 * -The second part contains the consonant string we just built. (If you add the second and first parts of this string together, you will get the original string.)
 * -The final part contains "ay".
 */

//Solution 4
function translatePigLatin(str) {
    return str
        .replace(/^[aeiou]\w*/, "$&way")
        .replace(/(^[^aeiou]+)(\w*)/, "$2$1ay");
}
translatePigLatin("consonant");

/**
 * Code Explanation
 * Use replace() on the string, using a regular expression to check if the first letter is a consonant and adding way at the end in this case. If the first letter is a consonant nothing will happen at this point.
 * Use replace() again to check for consonants at the beginning of the word and to move it or them to the end of the word and add ay at the end.
